### Hi there, I'm Emily ðŸ‘‹

I am a third year at Washington University in St. Louis where I'm majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Spanish. I just returned from a fall semester abroad in Madrid, Spain, but I'm back in St. Louis to finish out my undergraduate degree.

Think we might work well together or just want to reach out? Shoot me an email at e.sheehan(at)wustl.edu! I'll be working as a SWE at Microsoft for the summer of 2023 but am always open to exploring new opportunities.
