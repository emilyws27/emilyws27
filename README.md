### Hi there, I'm Emily ðŸ‘‹

I am a third year at Washington University in St. Louis where I'm majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Spanish. I just returned from a fall semester abroad in Madrid, Spain, but I'm back in St. Louis to finish out my BS in CS. I'll be graduating in 4 years with two degrees-- after I confer my BS this spring, I'll be spending my fourth year at WashU obtaining my MS in Computer Science as well.

I love working on new projects; if you have something in mind or just want to chat, shoot me an email at e.sheehan(at)wustl.edu! I'll be working as a SWE at Microsoft for the summer of 2023 but am always open to exploring new opportunities.
