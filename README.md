### Hi there, I'm Emily ðŸ‘‹

I am a third year at Washington University in St. Louis where I'm majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Spanish. I'm studying abroad this fall in Madrid, Spain, but I spent the summer (2022) working at Zillow on the Billing Development team. I created a multi-invoice payment system to ease the transaction process for landlords with multiple properties.

Right now, my primary focus is  [Hack WashU](https://hackwashu.com)! My friends and I are organizing WashU's first hacakthon in over 7 years, and I'd love it if you'd check us out. Our event is taking place THIS weekend-- October 14-16, 2022.

Technically speaking, I have a diverse skillset. I am confident in my abilities in the following areas, but I am always working to build out my knowledge base:
>- Backend Development
>- Data Science
>- Quantum Computing
>- DevOps

Think we might work well together or just want to reach out? Shoot me an email at e.sheehan(at)wustl.edu! I'll be working as a SWE at Microsoft for the summer of 2023 but am always open to exploring new opportunities.
