### Hi there, I'm Emily ðŸ‘‹

I am a third year at Washington University in St. Louis where I'm majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Spanish and Anthropology. I'm studying abroad this fall in Madrid, Spain, but I spent the summer working at Zillow on the Billing Development team. I created a multi-invoice payment system to ease the transaction process for landlords with multiple properties.

> Right now, my primary focus is  [Hack WashU](https://hackwashu.com)! My friends and I are organizing WashU's first hacakthon in over 7 years, and I'd love it if you'd check us out. Our event is taking place in just a few short weeks-- October 14 - 16, 2022.

My skills include:
- Backend development
- Data Science
- Quantum computing
- DevOps

Feel free to shoot me an email at e.sheehan(at)wustl.edu!
